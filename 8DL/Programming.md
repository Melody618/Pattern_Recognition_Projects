# Image Classification with CIFAR-10

## Programming
Please install PyTorch and run the \href{https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html}{CIFAR-10 tutorial}.
If you want to use TensorFlow or other deep learning frameworks, please find corresponding CIFAR-10 tutorial for that framework and run it.

If you successfully run the tutorial, write "Success"in the report and otherwise please write "Failed".
For this assignment report, only this single word is required, no details/accuracies/codes are needed. 
The assignment intends to get you familiar with the deep learning library.
If you have already trained some deep classifiers using any deep learning library before, you can safely ignore the tutorial and directly write "Success" in the report.
