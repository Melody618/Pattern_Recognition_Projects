\section{Programming: $k$-NN Classifier on MNIST}
Manually implement $k$-NN classifier and run on MNIST.
Please follow the official train/test split of MNIST\footnote{http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/}.

- Use 100, 300, 1000, 3000, 10000, 30000, 60000 training samples and compare the performance.
- Use different values of $k$ and compare the performance.
- Use at least three different distance metrics and compare the performance.

In this assignment, you are \emph{NOT} allowed to use any existing libraries or code snippets that provides $k$-NN algorithm.
